# AI Usage Report - AI Analytics Dashboard

## AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools**: Cursor IDE (AI-powered development), GitHub Copilot (code completion and generation)
- **Key use cases**: 
  - Cursor IDE for intelligent code completion and AI-assisted development
  - GitHub Copilot for real-time code suggestions and autocomplete functionality

## Sample Prompts

### 1. Dashboard Component Architecture
```
Create a comprehensive analytics dashboard using React 18, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components. The dashboard should include:

REQUIREMENTS:
- 4 metric cards displaying KPIs (Revenue, Users, Growth, Conversion) with icons and trend indicators
- 3 interactive charts: line chart for time-series data, bar chart for platform comparison, donut chart for sentiment analysis
- Sortable data table with pagination showing recent transactions
- Loading skeletons for all components with staggered animations
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop

TECHNICAL SPECS:
- Use shadcn/ui Card, Badge, and Button components
- Implement Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Include error boundaries and loading states
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels

OUTPUT: Complete functional components with TypeScript types and responsive design
```

### 2. Animation System Implementation
```
Implement a comprehensive animation system for the dashboard using Framer Motion with the following specifications:

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Staggered entrance animations for metric cards (0.1s delay between each)
- Smooth page transitions with fade-in/out effects (300ms duration)
- Loading skeleton animations with pulse effects
- Hover states for interactive elements with scale transforms
- Reduced motion support for accessibility (respects prefers-reduced-motion)

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Use transform and opacity for GPU acceleration
- Implement will-change CSS property for animated elements
- Add animation cleanup on component unmount
- Optimize for 60fps performance

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Create custom animation variants for consistent timing
- Add intersection observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Implement proper exit animations for route changes
- Include fallback states for users with motion sensitivity
```

### 3. Data Visualization System
```
Build a comprehensive charting system using Recharts with TypeScript for an analytics dashboard:

CHART SPECIFICATIONS:
- Line Chart: Time-series data with gradient fills, custom tooltips, and responsive design
- Bar Chart: Platform comparison with custom colors, animations, and legend
- Donut Chart: Sentiment analysis with percentage displays and hover interactions

FEATURES REQUIRED:
- Custom tooltips with formatted data display
- Responsive design that adapts to container size
- Smooth animations on data updates
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Dark/light theme compatibility
- Export functionality for charts

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Create reusable chart components with TypeScript interfaces
- Add proper error handling for data loading
- Implement loading states for chart rendering
- Include chart legends and axis customization
```

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated**: 70% - Component architecture, animation systems, data visualization setup, responsive design patterns, accessibility implementation
- **Manual coding**: 20% - Custom business logic, data context providers, performance optimizations, deployment configuration
- **Customization**: 10% - Fine-tuning AI suggestions, adapting components to specific design requirements, implementing custom animations and interactions

**AI Platform**: Cursor IDE + GitHub Copilot
